# Rascal Metaprogramming Language and Language Workbench

Rascal MPL is a programming language specifically designed to analyze and manipulate code in
any data format or programming language. This means code generation, code analysis, code visualization,
anything that you can do to code and with code, Rascal is designed to make it easy.

In particular the creation of IDEs for new Programming Languages and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)
is easy with Rascal. The Rascal VScode extension is a so-called Language Workbench.

   * http://www.rascal-mpl.org
   * http://www.usethesource.io

## Features

* R-LSP: IDE features for the Rascal metaprogramming language (parsing, syntax highlighting, type-checking, REPL terminal)
* P-LSP: "language parameterized" LSP server for languages expressed in Rascal. From a syntax definition you can start running your own LSP in vscode in a few steps.
* Rascal terminal: highly integrated terminal REPL that allows you to:
   * script and experiment with ad-hoc code analyses and visualizations
   * register new DSLs with VSCode using the P-LSP
   * experiment and test new DSL features

The Rascal VScode extension currently is bundled with the following libraries:
   * Rascal standard library
   * Rascal-LSP LanguageServer library
   * Java analysis library based on Eclipse JDT

## Requirements

* Installed JDK _11_
* However, the extension will propose to download the right JDK for you if you do not have it yet.

## Extension Settings

No settings so far.

## Known Issues

This extension is slowly but surely stabilizing, some stuff is still buggy. Please consider it an beta preview version.  Your constructive feedback is much appreciated at <https://github.com/usethesource/rascal-language-servers/issues>. The Rascal support does not include an interactive visual debugger yet, or debugger support for domain specific languages.

**This extension works best with Java 11; but running it on Java 17 reportedly works as well**

For other things we are working on have a look here:

## Release Notes

### 0.6.3

* bugfix for writes to VS Code virtual file systems initiated from rascal (only first 8KB of the write was correctly transferred)

### 0.6.2

* Bugfix for RASCAL.MF validator ([#225](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues/225))
### 0.6.1

* bumped rascal to 0.28.3 for performance fixes around maven and various bugfixes
* typechecking with latest 0.14.6 version of rascal-maven-plugin (and using linked rascal-library) to avoid outdated typepal files
* now allowing jdk 17 as runtime, we'll still install 11 as default, but jdk 17 seems to work.
* Bugfix for automatic jdk downloader on aarch64 osx (Apple M1 for example)
* RASCAL.MF files are now checked for common errors and incorrect configurations

### 0.6.0

* bumped rascal to 0.28.0 for the addition of vis::Graphs and fixes in util::Sampling and vis::Charts.
* fixed issues with the IDEServices::edit function, in the VScode terminal context and VScode parameterized DSL LSP server context, with logical locations and locations with line/column information (both previously unsupported), for use in interactive visualizations (for example).
* allow vscode extensions to use rascal-vscode independently of installed rascal; this means DSL implementations can run their own native extension when they are finished being developed.
* as a result, rascal-vscode is now also an independent npm package.

### 0.5.6

* fixes [issue](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues/203) which was caused by an issue in the rascal project.
* bumped rascal to 0.27.3 for the above fix.

### 0.5.5

This release is about including a new version of the rascal project, 0.27.2:

* fixes [issue](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues/1719) with variable scope leakages for optimized visit statements
* adds util::Validator for validating complex untyped hierarchical structures (such as obtained from XML, JSON or YAML)
* added vis::Charts for eight basic chart types
* redesign of lang::json::IO with more natural mapping to JSON objects, but more precarious constraints for mapping back. See util::Validator for bridging the new gap if you have a complex ADT with lots of overloading and many constructors per type. The default mapping only supports simple enums and single constructors per ADT.

### 0.5.4

* fixes an issue with [unsetRec issue](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal/issues/1705).
### 0.5.2

* fixed efficiency issue in use of the `project:///` scheme for browsing file hierarchies, like for example in getASTs function for Java.
* new logo

### 0.5.1

* upgraded to latest version of rascal (0.26.2) to fix an issue that become more present with the multiple evaluators feature

### 0.5.0

* Now using rascal 0.24.7
* Rascal DSLs can now use multiple evaluators if they want (see discussion in [#181](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal-language-servers/issues/181))
* Rascal DSLs do not get typepal on the PathConfig/evaluator search path by default. Only rascal & rascal-lsp.
* `unregisterLanguage` was added to clear all or parts of a language
* Rascal REPLs get a progressbar while starting. This provides more feedback that something is happening, especially until the  [performance regression on windows](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal-language-servers/issues/187) is fixed.

### 0.4.0

* Now using rascal 0.24.6

* Updated java & node dependencies to latest releases
* Improved performance of DSL init (specifically the time spent on generating parsers)


### 0.3.0

* Rascal DSLs get more flexibility (and performance) in how they contribute the information back to VS Code. Summaries work as base, but developers can defined custom functions for specific requests from VS Code.
* Rascal DSLs can parse without waiting for other request to finish
* Now using Rascal 0.24.2
### 0.2.4

* Version bumps for typepal and rascal-core with improved typechecking efficiency.
* Better error reporting for the Rascal LSP server and the parameterized LSP server.
* Fixes around status progress bars.
* Fix for packaging of rascal-lsp jar (which helped remove spurious type-checking errors in clients of the LanguageServer library modules)

### 0.2.0

* Moved to Java 11
* Upgrade to newer Rascal type-checker
* Early support for cross-project rascal dependencies for both REPL & type-checker
